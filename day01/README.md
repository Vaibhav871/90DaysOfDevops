## Day 01 Introduction To Devops 
## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a way of working that brings together software developers (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) teams. It's all about teamwork, using smart tools, and making the process of building and running software smoother and faster.

## What are Automation, Scaling, and Infrastructure?

1. **Automation**: Using computers to do repetitive tasks automatically. It's like setting up a domino chain - once you start it, it keeps going on its own.

2. **Scaling**: Making your system bigger or more powerful to handle more work. Think of it like adding more workers to a factory line when orders increase.

3. **Infrastructure**: The basic setup needed to run your software. It's like the foundation and framework of a house, but for your computer programs.

## Why is DevOps Important?

1. **Faster Delivery**: Gets new features to users quicker.
2. **Better Teamwork**: Helps different teams work together smoothly.
3. **Fewer Mistakes**: Catches problems early before they become big issues.
4. **Saves Time and Money**: Automatic processes are often cheaper and faster.
5. **Happier Customers**: Quicker updates and fewer problems mean satisfied users.
